# Remove applications from gnome launcher

App launchers shown in GNOME Activities are located either in `/usr/share/applications/` or `~/.local/share/applications/` as `.desktop` files.

You can hide an individual app launcher from Activities by adding an extra `NoDisplay=true` line to the corresponding .desktop file.

It is generally not advisable to edit the `.desktop` file located in `/usr/share/applications/`. Instead copy the file to `~/.local/share/applications/` first and make the change to the copied file.
